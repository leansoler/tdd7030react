## Exercise

It is required to implement a UI that allows to enter a single string and shows automatically the same string but replacing the vowels with numbers. For example:

- Leandro = L34ndr0
- Ignacio = 1gn4c10
- Mariano = M4r14n0

The UI must consist of:

- One textfield where the user should enter the string
- One button to perform the operation
- A section for errors like entering numbers in the string
